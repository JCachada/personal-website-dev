      <description>Please note: These are my thoughts on the books at the time that I read them and wrote about it. My opinions change with time, with experience, etc. These are not gospel on what I think of a book - they are snapshots of a particular time.&#xA;The list The image is ordered by the date of publication, not by any particular rating system. I will, however, share with you what I rated each book as.</description>

      <title>2022 Book Recommendation List</title>

      <description>I get asked for book recommendations a lot, mostly by friends of mine who know I spend an inordinate amount of time reading. This year, I thought it would be nice to have a centralized place I could point people to. I would also like to take this as an opportunity to reflect on this year&amp;rsquo;s readings and collate my thoughts on the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to come back to them years later and notice how your thoughts on books evolve with your aging and shifts in perception - this way I&amp;rsquo;ll have a snapshot of what I thought of them when I first read them, which will be like a brain photograph when I&amp;rsquo;ve well forgotten what I read this year.</description>
