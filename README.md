# personal-website-dev

MIT License. Personal website built as a way to refocus on what's important and support the tiny, readable internet.

This website is based on a branch of https://bearblog.dev/ built for the Hugo static site generator (https://gohugo.io/). It uses https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog.

My old website, built with Gatsby, lives at: https://github.com/JCachada/personal-website-dev-old
