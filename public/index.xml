      <description>This is a short and sweet post. I am looking for people interested in beta-reading my debut novel. Having a good group of beta-readers will allow me to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s as good as it can be before I send it to editors.
You can get more information and sign up to be a beta reader here.
I look forward to hearing from you.</description>

      <description>Back in 2020, when I was trying to make the best of my career in tech, I built myself a website using a technology called GatsbyJS. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly well designed, but I did it from scratch, and I was proud of how it turned out. You can still look at the code for it here. 1
I had plans to use that website as a showcase for myself. I shared my rÃ©sumÃ© there.</description>
