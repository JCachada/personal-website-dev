# about joão

Hey - I'm João (but it's fine to call me Joao, especially if the tilde doesn't exist on your keyboard.) My pronouns are he/him. This is my little garden on the internet.

I currently work as an Engineering Manager for a Fintech company, [Primer](https://primer.io). If you're interested in my professional life, you should probably check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcachada/). Sometimes I will post things to this website that relate to my profession, but (hopefully) not too often. There's much funner stuff
for us to bond over.  

I am passionate about many things: stories, for instance, in all of their shapes and forms. In another life, I was once a half-decent competitive card game player. Nowadays I play chess sometimes. I have strong opinions about privacy and the Internet. 

<p>I am currently working on my debut novel. I write about that, as well as about anything else that comes to my mind. I write when I feel like I have something to say, without a 
base commitment to posting frequency or subject matter. I can guarantee that, when I write, it will be about something I'm excited or opinionated about. Usually both.</p class>

  <li>Learning things</li>
  <li>Nature and animals</li>

  <li>Video and board games</li>
  <li>Programming as a means to create things. I have no particular love for programming as a science, only as a tool - there is beauty in clean code, but for me the magic of programming is in how it lets you conjure things into existence.</li>
