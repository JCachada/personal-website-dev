# Hi! I'm J. Cachada.

### This is my garden on the internet. 

---

That means it's not just a run-of-the-mill personal website. I want it to flourish and be healthy. I want to get joy from working on it and I want to 
put a decent part of myself into that work. If I'm fortunate, I want to see people grow into what I make and enjoy it.  

I am passionate about many things: stories, for instance, in all of their shapes and forms. In another life, I was once a half-decent competitive card game player. Nowadays I'm quite a bad chess player. I love the game anyway, and I am having fun learning to be better at it.

I am currently working on my debut novel. I write about that, as well as about anything else that comes to my mind. I write when I feel like I have something to say, without a 
base commitment to posting frequency or subject matter. I can guarantee that, when I write, it will be about something I'm excited or opinionated about. Usually both.
